Please download the background music and place it in this directory:

**Required File:** `headphonk.mp3`
**Artist:** Walen - HEADPHONK
**Location:** `/Users/manitmishra/Desktop/renderwood/my-first-video/public/audio/headphonk.mp3`

## Instructions

1. Download "Walen - HEADPHONK" audio file (MP3 format)
2. Rename it to `headphonk.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory

The video composition expects the audio file at:
